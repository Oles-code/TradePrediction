# TradePrediction
Description:
 - As part of my A-Level NEA I developed a mock trading platform, which used real time data on a variety of different stocks
 - In addition to the platform I developed my own machine learning algorithms which aimed to predict price on these stocks 30 days into the future, and display to the user either a buy, sell or hold action
 - This algorithm worked by mapping a variety of curves onto past price, storing coefficients and the price of the stock 30 days in the future, it would then merge this into the data of similar curves which had been found earlier, and determine whether or not that kind of curve was of any value, i.e. if there was a significant enough change after it occurred, consistently enough for it to be deemed a feature
 - These selected curves where then stored in a csv

A much more thorough report, which addtionally details the various data science techniques explored, can be found in the attached pdf
